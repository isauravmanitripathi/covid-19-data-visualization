# covid-19-data-visualization
This is a basic data visualizer, written in java. You can use this to plot different charts and graph based on data provided in a csv or xlsx file. 
The program works as following: 
1. Run GUI 
2. Import the csv file
3. You will be able to see your csv file opened 
4. Click on edit, and then draw chart. 
5. Select what kind of chart you want to see. 
6. there are two columns, the first columns will only take input as a string and second one will take input as an integer. (we were asked to do this, by my university
professors). 
7. so you can select the date column and the other as string column. The data column is counted as string because the csv file we were working on had (/) in it. 
8. Now we will be able to see your charts. You can save your chart, change properties of the chart (ex: color, shipe, shape), you can zoom in, and you have the 
ability to directly print the chart from the GUI itself. 
(I am working on forecast, i will complete if i have some time left.)
